      <h2>Everything About Ants</h2>
      <p>Ants are considered to be one of the most common insects as you can find
      them almost anywhere. They are social insects so they live in large colonies
      ranging from a <strong>few thousand up to millions of ants per colony</strong>.
      There are over <strong><em>12,000</em></strong> known ant species to date.</p>
    <!--  <br>  -->
      <p>As a whole, ant populations are stable. However, particular ant species
      like the Black bog ant and the Narrow-headed ant are endangered</p>

<!-- I use the article code below to group all of the differetn species of ants
and make a semi chart with them -->

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Most ants are omnivores. To live in variety of habitats, ants have modified their behavior and
      physical features so most ant characteristics can vary wildly between
      species. Ants can lift 10-50 times their body weight. They do not have ears
      so they hear by feeling the vibrations in the ground through their feet. Lastly,
      ants benefit ecosystems by dispersing seeds, pollinating plants, and improving
      the quality of soil.</p>
